%% @doc this module implements state machine that decides which
%% vbucket moves can be started when and when necessary view
%% compactions can be performed.
%%
%% Overall idea is we want to move as many vbuckets as possible in
%% parallel but there are certain limits that we still need to
%% enforce. More below.
%%
%% Input is old and new vbucket map, from which it computes moves as
%% well as 2 parameters that describe concurrency limits.
%%
%% First limit is number of concurrent backfills into/out-of any
%% node. The idea is moving vbucket involves reading entire vbucket
%% from disk and sending it to destination node where entire vbucket
%% needs to be persisted. While this phase of vbucket move occurs
%% between this two nodes it's undesirable to do backfill phase
%% affecting any of those two nodes concurrently. We support limit
%% higher than 1, but in actual product it's 1.
%%
%% Second limit is how many vbucket we move into/out-of any node
%% before pausing moves and forcing views compaction.
%%
%% Current model of actions required as part of vbucket move are:
%%
%% a) build complete replica of vbucket on future master (backfill
%% phase). For this phase as pointed out above we have first limit
%% that affects both old master and future master. Note: we
%% consciously ignore the fact that we can also have incoming
%% backfills into future replicas in this phase. Those backfills
%% currently are currently not affected by or affect any limits.
%%
%% b) ensure that indexes are built for new vbucket on new master and
%% rest of vbucket takeover. That phase notably can happen
%% concurrently for many vbuckets on any node for both incoming and
%% outgoing vbucket moves. We actually try to pack as many of them as
%% possible so that indexer which is currently slowest part of
%% rebalance is always busy.
%%
%% c) (involves multiple vbucket moves at once) do view
%% compaction. This phase _cannot_ happen concurrently with any
%% vbucket moves. I.e. we want views to be as quiescent as possible
%% (i.e. no massive indexing of incoming vbucket moves at least). As
%% noted above we try to do several vbucket moves before pausing for
%% views compactions. Because compacting after every single vbucket
%% move is expensive.

%%   v   \--------------------------------/   vbucket moves.
%%
%%
%% In that image you can see that backfills of 2 vbuckets between same
%% pair of nodes cannot happen concurrently, but next phase is
%% concurrent, after which there's view compaction on both nodes that
%% logically affect both moves (and prevent other concurrent moves)
%%
%% vbucket moves are picked w.r.t. this 2 constrains and we also have
%% heuristics to decide which moves to proceed based on the following
%% understanding of goodness:
%%
%% a) we want to start moving active vbuckets sooner. I.e. prioritize
%% moves that change master node and not just replicas. So that
%% balance w.r.t. node's load on GETs and SETs is more quickly
%% equalized.
%%
%% b) given that indexer is our bottleneck we want as much as possible
%% nodes to do some indexing work all or most of the time
